  - term: complex content object
    definition: |
      Abbreviated CCO, this is an item that may be more metadata than content, stored many to a file, as opposed to more typical text content units like chapters or topics, which may have some metadata but are mainly text and images.
      See <<chapter-managing-complexity>>.

  - term: dependency, software
    definition: |
      A separate software product that is required for the development or operation of another application.

  - term: deprecation
    definition: |
      The process of designating product features for cessation of support.
      Whenever an existing feature is slated to be disabled in a future release, providers notify users the functionality will cease.
      This flagging is the actual act of deprecation.
      Actual removal or cessation of support is a separate operation.

# end::cco-example[]
  - term: dynamism (in CMSes)
    definition: |
      At a minimum, a content management system is _dynamic_ if it enables the setting of variables for tokenized substitution inside parsed content.
      That is, users can embed references to outside data or content inside preprocessed source, which will be populated by that outside data or content, depending on which external content is established as the _value_ of any given _key_ (token).
      Other elements of dynamism may include conditional processing, which is often necessary for the proper establishment and processing of variables.

  - term: FOSS

  - term: Markdown
    definition: |
      One of the lightest weight and most popular textual markup languages, popularized on GitHub, StackOverflow, various forums and comments systems, and numerous other places.
      Markdown, however, is not a dynamic language.

      Thorough integration testing ensures all still-supported features and functionality remain backward compatible.

  - term: relational database
    definition: |
      A complex, multi-table data source that is structured according to a defined schema and primarily accessed using queries.
      As opposed to flat files, RDBs are almost always stored as binary files and therefore opaque to most source control systems.

  - term: release cycle
    definition: |
      The full set of procedures involved in planning and distributing a version of a software product.
      The release cycle includes planning, coding, testing, packaging, distributing, and any other tasks involved in turning software from a set of ideas to a new edition for production use.

      A file-storage system for _source code_, which tracks metadata about the code files and tracks changes across user-established _versions_.
      Commonly referred to as a “repo”.

  - term: REST API
    definition: |
      An API (see <<glossary-api,API>>) that listens for and responds to HTTP requests to established endpoints.
      A “RESTful” service waits for an HTTP client request, such as a _POST_, _GET_, or _DELETE_ transaction at a specific URI, enabling third-party developers to build applications to interact with that service based on documented functionality and permissable formats for exchanging data.
      (REST stands for “Representational State Transfer”, which I had long-since forgotten before I just looked it up, because it is never used.)

      Relevant examples include Wordpress.com, GitHub, Slack, and Office 365.
      Pronounced _sass_.

  - term: small data
    definition: |
      Datasets that are limited in count and complexity.
      Small data can be stored in flat files, with or without schematic constraints.
      Distinguished more in terms of the subjects of data suitable for such storage systems, namely recordsets of limited volume.
      Similar to Big Data, small data structures usually support nested attributes represented by flat formats like XML, JSON, and YAML.
