    Digi's complex hardware-embedded, Linux-based platforms posed the most dynamic challenge I have ever encountered.
    I am proud to have solved it using LiquiDoc CMF.
    Four parallel product lines, each with hardware and software variations that all require distinct references and instructions that absolutely have to be kept accurate.
    Together with an eager senior technical writer and some of Digi's own engineers, Codewriting delivered a well-organized and -instructed documentation platform their engineers love using on a regular basis.
    They have even begun extending and scaling the platform, sourcing with AsciiDoc and YAML files embedded in numerous product repos from which they compile the Embedded products.
    The Digi Embedded docs site is now the *flagship LiquiDoc CMF project*.

    Just before launching its own enterprise product, Okera needed to “platformify” and systematize its Markdown-based docs.
    In addition to content services, I tooled a basic Jekyll site to properly build and serve their content, as well as adding Algolia Search and numerous other features and theming.

    This simple “static web app” called for some cool JavaScript (solved with jQuery) as well as Liquid templating and other cool elements of a robust Jekyll site, such as Jekyll collections.
    This project posed a terrific set of content and data sourcing challenges, essentially solved with YAML and Liquid.

    This site hosts the docs for my own documentation tool and framework--of course itself using the technologies it covers.
    This is a fully open-sourced example of complex product docs single-sourced with LiquiDoc CMF.
    It also documents the AJYL docstack more broadly, demonstrating how to combine AsciiDoc, Jekyll, YAML, and Liquid into a powerful, flexible documentation environment, for software products and beyond.
    *This project is still very much a work in progress.*
