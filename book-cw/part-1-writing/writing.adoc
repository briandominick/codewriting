= Part One: Writing

[partintro]

No matter what else you learn or forget about the work of technical documentation, remember as much as you can about _writing_ and _writing technically_.
The rest changes a lot from gig to gig, but the need for clear, concise, and compelling technical content will remain.
Documentation workflows and methodologies, platforms and toolchains -- all the stuff you need proficiency in to call yourself a DocOps practitioner matters not at all if you cannot write complete, accessible product explanations and instructions.

The chapters in Part One address the craft of writing about software products.
The rest of the noise of the field can wait; the one thing we all have in common is a love of language, so there we'll start.
