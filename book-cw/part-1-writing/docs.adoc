= Docs

[abstract]
The cliche advice for writers of all kinds is that we should read more to get better.
Mere reading does not suffice for technical writers.
It is a hard pill to swallow, but there is no way around the first rule of writing, modified for our field: you have to _use_ lots of product documentation in order to write good product documentation.

== What Docs Are

As you'll see, I have a liberal view of what constitutes “technical documentation” at a software company -- probably more in tune with what many call “technical communications”.
I also have a broad definition of what falls under the purview of technical documentation management.
I prefer to be within one hop of every significant technology document the Engineering organization touches, from knowledge base articles to slide decks to drafts of blog posts and white papers.
This does not mean I want to be in charge of it all; I certainly don't want to review it, let alone edit it.
I just like to know what is where, or at least how to find everything.
And it means I want the engineers I work with to know I care about all that stuff.

At Rocana, I worked regularly with developers and project managers in Engineering, as well as everybody in Customer Success.
Having _their_ docs in order makes my life better in numerous ways which we'll explore throughout this book.
For now, I want to introduce the theme that bad documentation is everybody's problem, not just users’.
And documentation itself is way more than just the docs you prepare for end users or third-party developers, or even anything you might need to produce for Marketing.
It's all of the meeting notes, specifications, task-management issues, use cases, support cases, Git commit messages, help desk tickets, and on and on.

Well kept, these are also your assets -- they include all the answers SMEs have forgotten or misremembered.
They won't contain everything you need, and they'll surely contain plenty of contradictions and stuff you would never want to release, yet it's all critical.
Some of this content is automatically organized, such as task/help tickets and code commits.
The rest must be actively curated, even if never examined closely.

This book is going to dwell plenty on what tech docs _are_, but first let's clear up what docs _aren't_.

== Docs Are Not for Reading

I try not to refer to _reading_ docs, but rather _using_ them.
That is because I believe, quite simply, that _good technical writing is not even meant to be read_.

Okay, if you consider books like this one to be _technical writing_, then _some_ technical writing is meant to be read like prose -- although I do not expect it to be read cover-to-cover or even in order.
Still, most product-related technical documentation will _not be_ read, no matter how it was intended by its authors.
And if your work will not be read conventionally, it makes little sense to write it as if it will be read conventionally.

If you're a technical writer more than you are a developer (and no, engineers, it doesn't count that you _feel like_ you spend more time writing docs than code), you probably love to write as much as any novelist, journalist, or poet.
If you're anything like me, you're working on a novel or three, and maybe you'll get the nerve to submit that cookbook to an agent someday soon.
But the only thing that's getting _published_ at the moment is that damn user manual, so you'd better believe we're going to _write_ that thing as if someone is _reading_ it.

Usually there is even a spot here or there, in the introduction or a sidebar, where we can open up that throttle and write a few contiguous paragraphs of prose, really let the wind of the open page have its way with our free-flowing hair.
We cherish the relative latitude and runway these interludes provide, even if we never quite achiev; flight.

Because mostly we don't write; instead:

* We _keep track of_ content that fits better in tables, charts, and lists than in paragraphs;
* We _follow our own instructions_, hoping to catch docs bugs before customers or developers do;
* We _chase down developers_, explaining that cave etchings are preferred to nothing, but secretly wondering why people who can code in seven programming languages can't be bothered to write a formatted list in English;
* We _pester our users and coworkers_ about the docs, whether they use them, "Why not?", "Could you maybe just give them a try?", and of course the old, "Yes, they were included with the installation and are on our website";
* We _prune, reformat, and edit_ scribbles, notes, and sometimes well-written content from SMEs;
* And we _create visualizations_ that we hope make sense to people who actually use this stuff (be that an end user or a designer who will upgrade our graphics).

When you look at a given page of a user manual or a section of a README, there might seem to be about as much of the _writer_ in _product documentation_ as there is the _jockey_ in a _horse race_.
It absolutely matters who is on the horse, but everybody knows the best horse will win as long as the jockey is competent.

But this analogy falls apart when you consider the variety of modern software products, and just how easy it is for today's software to depart from convention and require unorthodox documentation.
If you are fortunate enough to document a product that is trying to reinvent its space, there may be no blueprint for how to convey that product to users.
They may be more dependent on your contextualization and conceptualization of the product than they typically need to be when they encounter a “new” solution, since most product interfaces are essentially ripoffs of the most successful player in the space.

Just because we do not always get to spout off freely as I am currently spouting does not mean decisions made by technical writers are not critical to the success of a product.
Docs may not close deals very often, but bad docs can frustrate, costing degrees of a potential customer's confidence.

== Reading Docs

All of that said, I do think one can appreciate good docs at face value.
Sometimes when I'm looking for a way to solve a problem, I run into some incidental aspect of another product's documentation, which I can appreciate only in the abstract.
Even at a glance, I recognize excellence in presentation, and the hair stands on the back of my neck.
We lucky kinksters who appreciate good docs on an aesthetic level have a distinct advantage: we notice great docs we can aspire to emulate.

There is no shame in loving good docs.
In fact, there is no shame in loving _bad_ docs.

== Reading Bad Docs

One of the first things you'll hear when you take over technical documentation for an organization is which of their competitors or upstream vendors they do _not_ want their product's docs to turn out like.
Take heed of this; while it's possible some bias against the third-party product is tainting their attitude toward the docs, the opposite is far more likely.
Your new coworkers are probably referring to poor documentation of a product they actually admire, if not a product they regularly use and may even adore on some level.
Learn what frustrates your coworkers about those docs, then try actually using the docs with that third-party product.

We'll talk a lot about getting to know how developers operate.
Earn the respect of coders you work with by walking in their shoes.
If several engineers on your team are frustrated because they've been told to work with a dependency library they don't love, there's a very good chance the library is poorly documented.
Go investigate and maybe play with that dependency.
Even if it's above your skill level and you fail, the process will yield benefits, empathy not least among them.
You will have a better understanding of what developers are talking and complaining about, and you'll have a functional analysis of what is frustrating about docs your coworkers use every day.

If you can repeat this process with users, whether they be third-party developers or end consumers, you'll glean even more insights.

== Talking Docs

Ask your friends and family whether and how they use docs.

// TODO section-fleshout Add some parameters for approaching this conversation

== Docs Tell a Story

Product documentation contributes to users' general impression of the product and the company that made it.
Much as I'll talk about modular docs (see <<topic-based-authoring>>) that can be parachuted into, documentation should paint a complete and accurate picture.
They should make _mastering_ your product seem plausible.

// TODO citations re about docs as narrative

I originally titled this subsection “Docs _Should_ Tell a Story”, but the truth is, even poor docs tell a story.
We'll get to that story in a second.

// TODO section-fleshout

== Docs are for Using, So Use Away

Use lots of documentation, and keep track of how you use it.

// TODO section-fleshout
// Include examples of excellent docs that can be followed along with. Perhaps a Git tutorial and some other tools that our readers will be most likely to use.

== Skim the Docs

Also in the “let's not kid ourselves” category: let's not pretend people _read_ the section of the docs they're using, even when they must use the docs.
Probably the smarter they (think they) are, the less attention they actually pay to documentation.

This is certainly true for me.
I must admit I tend to skip to the place I need -- not just the section, but then within that section.
I have a tendency to skip over introductory text and go right to a reference or list of steps.
This is poor practice on my part, but good documentation is ready for it.

Good docs bold (or otherwise highlight) critical information in large text blocks.

Admonition (a.k.a. "callout") blocks are even more unmistakable.
They should be used judiciously; crying wolf with lots of bright, scary boxes of `WARNING` and `NOTE` content can desensitize users.

[WARNING]
Admonitions are incredibly valuable, so earn users’ trust by keeping them concise and critical.

== README, the Root Doc

The README file that accompanies source code is the heart of any software project.
It tells the user what the software does, how to get started using it, and any other information developers deem pertinent.
The audience might be other developers looking to contribute to or fork the source code, or they might be end users.
Sometimes the README is the only user-facing documentation for a project, especially during early development.

The README is not traditionally the domain of an end-user documentarian, but DocOps specialists will at least want to begin appreciating the value of a good README, even for proprietary (non-open-source) products.
Truthfully, I think documentarians should “co-own” the README with engineers, if only to oversee that it stays up to date and as clear as possible.

[TIP]
Even if it's not your job to write the official README for your project, if you already write docs for a software product, consider creating a “shadow README” on your own time as you work through this book.
Maybe by the time we're done, you can offer concrete contributions to your real-world product's README.

A good README contains all the basics needed by core engineers, third-party developers, and daring end users/beta testers alike.
Even for a polished product that can be delivered through an app store or a package manager, the README holds it all together.

At risk of exaggerating its importance, I really do believe the README is the most important _file_ in any software project -- it's the seed file for code and docs alike.
And this is where our first exercise comes in, intended to keep us thinking about that lean, iterative approach to building out a product's docs.

The best README files are accurate; everything else is gravy.

I am as guilty as anyone of letting READMEs languish.
But I readily admit, if the codebase is ahead of my README, I'm failing everybody on down the line.
Engineers, documentarians, third-party committers of either type, and early adopters (who enable your repo to become popular) all depend on your flagship file not pissing them off.

In terms of actual content, the README provides exactly the appropriate amount of information to get started with your product, from any role.
If the repo is just for developers to fork and build, then link end users to the downloads page right at the top.
Don't waste their time.
If you have a separate wiki or guide set up for each role, pass everybody along to the right landing page for their docs needs.
But for an immature project, the README should be fairly rich.
A good README includes the following sections; include them as soon as you're able to declare _any_ definitive high-level statement about them.

overview::
What does your product do?
This may seem obvious, but a shocking proportion of open source projects seem to assume we already know exactly why we've arrived at this product.
+
A mature overview includes:

* who will find this product useful
* what dev languages are used
* any environmental requirements
* an honest assessment of the project's status and progress

quickstart/demo::
Surely your product has a bootstrap or quickstart option, or an online demo.
Or at least some screenshots.
I need something early on that _does_ cater to the audience that knows (or has just decided) this product _should_ meet their needs, so they're ready to dig in and see it action.
The more hands-on, the sooner, the better.

installation/setup::
If all you showed me in the last section was screenies or a demo, it's time to get me up and running.
Maybe setup isn't so simple; let me know that now, but invite me to struggle along with you.
Don't decide for me how badly I need your product; warn me that I might pull my hair out trying to get it to work for me, but give me a fighting chance.

usage::
Okay, now that I'm installed and configured, what does it do and how does it work?
Maybe you're not ready to give me the complete lowdown, but I need at least a nudge.

contributing::
Now that I'm playing with your software, how can I report bugs or share my patch proposals?
+
A good “Contributing” section includes:

* a warm, authentic message to reassure potential contributors that you actually want their input
* an explicit list of the kinds of contributions most needed
* clear instructions for each type of contribution
* an overview of the review/approval process for code/docs contributions

licensing/redistribution::
Make it as clear as you can how you intend the product to be reused.
You don't have to promise to support users in any way, and you needn't provide any kind of warrantee, but you should make it clear the conditions under which your source code (as well as the packaged product) may be modified and redistributed.

We will be exploring README file contents throughout the rest of this book.
Not only is it the first source file your team should ever initiate, it also must be reviewed with every new merge or release.
And while it's okay to begin with a nascent, skeletal README, eventually it should be a reliable core element of your project.
