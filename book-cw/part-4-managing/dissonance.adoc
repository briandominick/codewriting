= Content Dissonance

[abstract]
As projects scale laterally and evolve over time, they require better handling of dimensions like versioning, forking, and localization.
Only a distributed source management system will offer the flexibility needed for such growth in a docs-as-code environment, but what if you start losing track of all that content?

== Version Entropy

Software and documentation have a natural tendency to diverge.
Given time, even with consistent attention, more gaps between word and truth appear.
In fact, if you're a _good_ technical writer, like I think I am, you're too interested in adding new content to fuss over constantly improving the existing stuff.
Only a _great_ technical writer sets aside that universal urge and always attends to the existing landscape.

Product artifacts in which the code no longer matches the expectations set by docs has suffered what I call _version rot_.
A sometimes-fatal affliction, version rot is almost always preceded by phases such as _version decay_ and _version wilting_, all due to the tendency of products to undergo _version entropy_ across release cycles.

[NOTE]
The malady _version lag_, by which documentation merely trails a released version, is a fundamentally different matter.
That said, version lag and version rot often mingle at the same engineering outfits.

This phenomenon can affect SaaS platforms at least as much as it affects installable artifacts, especially given how differently (and poorly) cloud-service operations sometimes handle releases.

[TIP]
If you are the tech writer for a SaaS shop with only one released, centralized version of one product, congratulations.
Keep this to yourself at the next meetup, though.

=== Keeping Track of Released Material

There are probably about a million ways to release software.
Consider the following data structure, intended to reflect several of the major considerations of releasing a software product.
If documentation management is your career, consider the permutations of potential disarray you may someday encounter, or the range of variables you may see from job to job.

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]
[source,yaml]
.Software Release Chaos Matrix (YAML)
----
include::../includes/snippets/chaos-matrix.yml[tags=software]
----

And that's just the software you have to document.
Now consider all the different ways that software needs to be documented, with that documentation delivered across the various channels through which the product is distributed.

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]
[source,yaml]
.Documentation Coverage & Delivery Chaos Matrix (YAML)
----
include::../includes/snippets/chaos-matrix.yml[tags=docs]
----

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]
Add several other factors that are difficult to appreciate even graphically, including

* the size of the documentation team;
* its relationship to Engineering, Product, Support, and possibly other organizations; not to mention
* the actual frequency of releases, each presumably carrying some default overhead.

The range of possibilities is truly enormous.
Nobody is going to have all the answers for all the possible permutations of a given set of documentation challenges.

As much as I presented this as an attempt either to impress or intimidate, the true purpose of the above listing is to demonstrate why this book has a strategic focus, rather than a tactical one.
Instead of trying to lay out a plan for every combination of factors and resources, let's examine how to use a systems approach to documentation challenges.

=== Feature Status Tracking

// TODO section-start
// When stuff changes about a feature, it needs to get documented.

== Localization
