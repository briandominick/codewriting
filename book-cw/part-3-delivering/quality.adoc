= Delivering Quality

[abstract]
Which practices and protocols best facilitate accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of coverage?

== Assuring Accuracy

I'm going to make a frightening suggestion to shock you a bit, only to walk it back slightly right afterward:
_technical documentation managers should own product accuracy_.

Right, so I don't mean we should take on quality assurance's job of making sure the released product meets specifications.
I mean documentation should consider maintaining the state of what the product requires and supports, not just what it does.
Let's face it, we end up being the last ones checking whatever spreadsheets whomever is keeping to track what is going into the product.
At some point, pretty much everybody has had hands on certain kinds of references: Product Management, project managers, at least one developer, maybe testing/QA, maybe even you if you came across it and got fussy.

=== References

Documentation of this nature is a good candidate for evaluating different systems to see what works now (and will be most likely scale) with your team.
This is strictly objective material -- product metadata, if you will -- about which there is a discernible truth: currently supported versions, current third-party integrations, licensed dependencies, known limitations.
In other words, product metadata is pretty much anything that is falsifiable about how the product fits into its market or ecosystem.

One collaborative platform will be more effective than the others in enabling your team to establish canonical documentation which aligns with existential truth.
That is, documentation that is definitive and accurately reflects reality.
If you have to allow Markdown, Excel, or WYSIWYG tools to ensure participation, just find a way to respect the "everything in code" mantra, and set up whatever tools will suit the task.

=== Diagrams

Another place where unifying engineers, product managers, and technical writers could be critical is maintaining internal and customer-facing diagrams.
Any depictions of product architecture, workflow, and so forth, are prime candidates for complex collaboration.

Whether you use UML (Ascii text-based diagram markup), OmniGraffle (full-featured diagramming WYSIWYG with XML source), or something in between, the key again is "everything in code".
Reviewers should be able to clearly see what has changed in a revision, and everyone needs to be able to contribute.

Keeping basic, canonical diagrams is more critical than teams realize.
Visualization is one of the best ways to establish cohesion of understanding internally.
This is where developers and product managers will often surface the different ways they see a product.
Standardize the way your organization does diagrams, and choose a tool with which everyone can at least tinker, if not create.

== Testing Docs

It is obvious that documentation can be manually tested, much the same way users test the product itself.
The practice usually involves users following along with the docs and making sure what happens on the screen matches what's in the documentation.

=== Manual Testing

While it's obvious what manual docs testing is, there are lots of best practices a good DocOps specialist will be mindful of.
