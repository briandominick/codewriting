My name is *Brian Dominick*.
I make, teach, and use powerful documentation development environments in support of forward-thinking product teams.

After two and a half years of reinventing docs at Big Data startup Rocana (just acquired by Splunk), I am eager to *work docs magic at new organizations*.
If you have an exciting project with challenging internal and user-facing documentation needs, let's talk.

Like *DevOps for docs*, I specialize in documentation *tooling and workflows* for maximum accuracy and currency of complicated documentation projects, tying engineers, third-party developers, and technical writers together with *collaborative solutions*.

My forthcoming book *_Codewriting_* lays out the new fundamentals of this practice, sometimes called *DocOps*.
Across 18 chapters of fresh concepts as well as concrete examples and exercises, _Codewriting_ explores a new approach to developing and maintaining docs -- one that draws extensively from practices and tooling proven by software engineering teams.
Early *drafts are available now* in the same open source repository from which the site you're now reading was built (details below).

My free and open source tool *LiquiDoc* enables true *single sourcing of docs and product* content, building and optimizing semi-structured data into content for rendering in docs and other user interfaces.
In combination with several technologies like Git, Asciidoctor, and Jekyll, LiquiDoc builds the site you're reading now, as well as my book -- all from the same source repo.
