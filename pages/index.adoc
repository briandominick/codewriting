What if documentation could be fully integrated with the product, from source repository to end-user delivery?

[.summary]

This site is both an experiment in, as well as living instruction of, an emerging system for *collaborative documentation developed in environments where docs are effectively code*.
--

[.pitch]
--
* docs sourced under the same *version control* regime as product code

* *canonical product info*, with a single source of truth informing the backend, user interfaces, and all docs (internal & user-facing)

* *developer tooling and infrastructure* available to documentarians -- Git, IDEs, testing, automation

* *dynamic content* processing such as conditional flows & variable substitution in the docs

* *modularity* -- mix and match docs source to meet the specific needs of product version, audience, and so forth

* docs *packaged and delivered* in the same flow as code, output in all the right places at exactly the right time

* *lean docs* drafted/generated throughout the dev process, from API to GUI

In other words, a holistic approach to writing, managing, and deploying fully integrated, highly accurate documentation.

You know, for shops that truly value good docs.

*Codewriting* is a website and a book, each drawn from the same open source codebase and sharing some of the same content.
The project exemplifies the *AJYL docstack*, a set of integrated technologies perfectly suited for demanding, collaborative technical documentation projects.

[NOTE]
AJYL stands for AsciiDoc, JAMstack, YAML, and Liquid.
For more, see the companion website about {ajyl_www_uri}[AJYL dockstack].

The content source is written in a _lightweight markup language_ called *AsciiDoc*, supported by *small data* files in *YAML* format.
The codebase is managed and processed by several awesome utilities, including *Git*, *Asciidoctor*, *Jekyll*, and my own tool, *LiquiDoc*.

And it is all available to anyone who finds it helpful.
No strings attached, though I'd love to hear from you.

*Codewriting's mission* is to expose what I've learned and help others acquire the skills to establish, maintain, and use great docs-as-code environments.
It is time for tech writers to become _codewriters_.
At its essence, codewriting is _docs hacking_.

You do not have to be a developer to take advantage of this system, which you can derive lessons from _a la carte_.
That said, if you are not yet a developer, this might be a great first step toward becoming one.
